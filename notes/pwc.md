# PWC

## Executive summary

- Efficient peer-to-peer transaction platform
- Lower costs, faster processes and greater flexibility
- Current barriers hindering the implementation of blockchain applications
- Some level of maturity in financial services but concepts only in energy and other sectors (*example in Brooklyn*)
- Opportunities for prosumers
- Wide range of energy use cases

## Blockchain 2.0

- A *smart contract* represents a digital protocol that automatically executes predefined processes of a transaction without requiring the involvement of a third party.
- It would be possible to create a fully automated smart contract between an energy producer and a consumer that autonomously and securely regulates both supply and payment.
- Private blockchains - where all participants are known and identified - allow for simpler governance structures.

## A look at other sectors

### Private blockchain models (Nasdaq)

- Operator can control who receives access
- (Ex-post) interventions possible
- Greater anonymity possible
- Lower operating costs and faster transactions
- No longer offer protection againt tampering
- **Private blockchains are similar to conventional client/server or cloud structures**
- **Nasdaq** uses its blockchain-based Private Market platform, used for pre-IPO traiding activities (start-up selling shares to investors prior to going public).
- In the past, lawyers, accountants and consultants have been required to execute and clear such transactions.
- In 2015, Nasdaq developed a cloud-based platform called *LINQ* which stores information on current shareholdings and related changes.
- *Just* a tool to maintain a record of past transactions.

### Smart contract applications on private blockchains (R3 & Barclays)

- **R3**: 45-strong consortium of major international banks
- Aim is to develop common industry standards
- First trade on **Corda** - its proprietary blockchain - on $3^{rd}$ March 2016
- In April 2016, Barclays demonstrated how Corda can be combined with smart contracts to trade derivatives.
- The value of a derivative is dependent on the future value of a certain underlying asset, e.g. the price of a share, an interest rate or the price of a commodity.


## A look around the world

### Possible use cases

- Energy sector differs from the financial industry since the physical itself (e.g. electricity) must also be taken into account.
- Transactions also involves trading of energy which is delivered via network infrastructure.

### Decentralised energy transaction and supply system

- Some consumers are called *prosumers* consume and dispose of generation capacity in the form of solar systems, small-scale wind turbines or CHP plants.
- Figure 11 represents the ultimate blockchain of energy.
- Energy networks would be controlled through smart contracts

### Selected current projects and market players

- **Block-Charge**: Blockchain applications in the area of electric mobility/EV charging
- **POWR**: Pilot project trialling a decentralised energy system
- **Power-peers**: Peer-to-peer marketing of eletricity. Not blockchain, *just* sharing self-generated energy with others through a peer-to-peer network.
- **Exergy**: Distributed servers to provide heat for homes, with supply billed via blockchain
- **Brooklyn Microgrid**: Pilot project connecting 10 households in Brooklyn through a blockchain-based microgrid
- **Solar Change**: Platform for the exchange of Solar-Coins
